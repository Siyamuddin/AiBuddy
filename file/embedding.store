2.-Whatever is expressed by means of letters, figures or\nmarks as explained by mercantile or other usage, shall be deemed to be\nexpressed by such letters, figures or marks within the meaning of this\nsection, although the same may not be actually expressed. Illustration\n  A writes his name on the back of a bill of exchange payable to his order. The meaning of the endorsement, as explained by mercantile usage, is\nthat the bill is to be paid to the holder. The endorsement is a document,\nand must be construed in the same manner as if the words \"pay to the\nholder\" or words to that effect had been written over the signature. “Valuable\nsecurity”\n30. The words \"valuable security\" denote a document which is, or purports\nto be, a document whereby any legal right is created, extended,\ntransferred, restricted, extinguished or released, or whereby any person\nacknowledges that he lies under legal liability, or has not a certain legal\nright. Illustration\n  A writes his name on the back of a bill of exchange. As the effect of this\nendorsement is to transfer the right to the bill to any person who may\nbecome the lawful holder of it, the endorsement is a \"valuable security\". “A will” 31. The words \"a will\" denote any testamentary document. Words\nreferring to\nacts include\nillegal\nomissions\n32. In every part of this Code, except where a contrary intention appears\nfrom the context, words which refer to acts done extend also to illegal\nomissions. “Act”\n“Omission”\n33. The word \"act\" denotes as well a series of acts as a single act: the\nword \"omission” denotes as well a series of omissions as a single\nomission. Acts done\nby several\npersons in\nfurtherance\n34.

such\nan act is\ncriminal by\nreason of\nits being\ndone with a\ncriminal\nknowledge\nor intention\n35. Whenever an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being done\nwith a criminal knowledge or intention, is done by several persons, each of\nsuch persons who joins in the act with such knowledge or intention is\nliable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone\nwith that knowledge or intention. Effect\ncaused\npartly by\nact and\npartly by\nomission\n36. Wherever the causing of a certain effect, or an attempt to cause that\neffect, by an act or by an omission, is an offence, it is to be understood\nthat the causing of that effect partly by an act and partly by an omission is\nthe same offence.

Co-\noperation\nby doing\none of\nseveral\nActs\nconstituting\nan offence\n37. When an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever\nintentionally co-operates in the commission of that offence by doing any\none of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits\nthat offence.

A and B administer the poison according to the\nagreement with intent to murder Z. Z dies from the effects of the several\ndoses of poison so administered to him. Here A and B intentionally co-\noperate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by\nwhich the death is caused, they are both guilty of the offence though their\nacts are separate.

 A is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is\nstanding by. Here if there was no want of proper caution on the part of A,\nhis act is excusable and not an offence. bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-print-11.html 20/192\n22/12/2024 The Penal Code, 1860\nAct likely to\ncause\nharm, but\ndone\nwithout\ncriminal\nintent and\nto prevent\nother harm\n81. Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the\nknowledge that it is likely to cause harm, if it be done without any criminal\nintention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of preventing or\navoiding other harm to person or property. Explanation.-It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be\nprevented or avoided was of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or\nexcuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that it was likely to\ncause harm. Illustrations\n  (a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any fault or\nnegligence on his part, finds himself in such a position that, before he can\nstop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty\npassengers on board, unless he changes the course of his vessel, and\nthat, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C\nwith only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A\nalters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in good\nfaith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat\nB, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run down the boat C by\ndoing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as\na matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to\nexcuse him in incurring the risk of running down C.

person abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an\noffence, or the commission of an act which would be an offence, if\ncommitted by a person capable by law of committing an offence with the\nsame intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. Explanation 1.-The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount\nto an offence although the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act. Explanation 2.-To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary\nthat the act abetted should be committed, or that the effect requisite to\nconstitute the offence should be caused. Illustrations\n  (a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B\nto commit murder. (b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D\nrecovers from the wound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder. Explanation 3.-It is not necessary that the person abetted should be\ncapable by law of committing an offence, or that he should have the same\nguilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty intention\nor knowledge.

(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven\nyears of age, to do an act which causes Z\u0027s death. B, in consequence of\nthe abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby, causes Z\u0027s\ndeath.

Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing\ndeath, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to\ncause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause\ndeath, commits the offence of culpable homicide. Illustrations\n  (a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing\ndeath, or with the knowledge that death is likely to be thereby caused. Z,\nbelieving the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has\ncommitted the offence of culpable homicide. (b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to\ncause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z\u0027s death induces B to fire at the\nbush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has\ncommitted the offence of culpable homicide. (c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is\nbehind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. Here, although A was\ndoing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did\nnot intend to kill B or cause death by doing an act that he knew was likely\nto cause death. Explanation 1. A person who causes bodily injury to another who is\nlabouring under a disorder, disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby\naccelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused his\ndeath. Explanation 2. Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who\ncauses such bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the death,\nalthough by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment the death\nmight have been prevented.

105/192\n22/12/2024 The Penal Code, 1860\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons\nand kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had\na premeditated design to kill any particular individual. When\nculpable\nhomicide is\nnot murder\nException 1.-Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst\ndeprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation,\ncauses the death of the person who gave the provocation or cause the\ndeath of any other person by mistake or accident. The above exception is subject to the following provisos:\n  Firstly.-That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the\noffender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person. Secondly.-That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience\nto the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of\nsuch public servant. Thirdly.-That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful\nexercise of the right of private defence. Explanation.- Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to\nprevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact. Illustrations\n  (a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z,\nintentionally kills Y, Z\u0027s child. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation\nwas not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by\naccident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation. (b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation fires\na pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who\nis near him, but out of sight.

But the words\nwhich a person uses may give to his gestures or preparation such a\nmeaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an\nassault.

133/192\n22/12/2024 The Penal Code, 1860\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z\u0027s possession without Z\u0027s\nconsent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a\nreward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefore\ncommitted theft. (m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z\u0027s library in Z\u0027s absence,\nand takes away a book without Z\u0027s express consent for the purpose\nmerely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is\nprobable that A may have conceived that he had Z\u0027s implied consent to\nuse Z\u0027s book. If this was A\u0027s impression, A has not committed theft. (n) A asks charity from Z\u0027s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes,\nwhich A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may\nconceive that Z\u0027s wife is authorized to give away alms. If this was A\u0027s\nimpression, A has not committed theft. (o) A is the paramour of Z\u0027s wife. She gives A valuable property, which A\nknows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has not\nauthority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits\ntheft. (p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A\u0027s own\nproperty, takes that property out of B\u0027s possession. Here, as A does not\ntake dishonestly, he does not commit theft. Punishment\nfor theft\n379. Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either\ndescription for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with\nboth. Theft in\ndwelling-\nhouse, etc. 380.
